//! Proof-of-concept meta-tracing JIT tier for cel-rust, built on the in-repo
//! `majit` framework (a Rust port of RPython's tracing JIT). Tracked as
//! cell-majit (issue #357).
//!
//! majit does not attach to cel-rust's live `Value::resolve_val` evaluator:
//! that path returns `Cow<'a, dyn Val>` and dispatches through trait objects /
//! `downcast_ref`, which is outside the restricted Rust subset majit can
//! meta-trace. Instead, a CEL `Program` (a fixed AST = green constant) is
//! lowered to a flat `i64`-word bytecode, and a small mainloop authored in the
//! traceable subset evaluates it over a batch of inputs. The de-risk phase
//! established the perf envelope (scalar arith 9-16x, slot-resolved policy
//! predicate ~6x over a clean interpreter, comprehensions 2-4x only when the
//! list length is a green constant and can be unrolled).
//!
//! ## M1 — smoke check ([`smoke`])
//!
//! A self-contained register-machine mainloop cloned from
//! `majit/examples/tinyframe`. It de-risks, before any CEL-IR work:
//!   * the `majit` crates build as cross-workspace path deps of `cel`,
//!   * the cranelift backend links here,
//!   * a hot loop actually traces + compiles (observed via
//!     `set_on_compile_loop`).
//!
//! ## M2+ — CEL AST -> traceable bytecode (planned)
//!
//! Lower the supported `Expr` subset (arithmetic, comparison, boolean, and
//! slot-resolved `Select`/member access) to the flat `i64`-word program, add a
//! batch evaluation API, and unroll green-length comprehensions. Any expression
//! outside the subset falls back to the stock tree-walking evaluator.
